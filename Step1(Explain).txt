 Task 1: Calculate Average

Explanation:
We want to find the average of a list of numbers. First, we add all the numbers together. Then, we divide the total by how many numbers are in the list.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input list of numbers →
Set sum = 0 →
Loop through the list and add each number to sum →
Calculate average = sum / count →
Output average →
End

Task 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Explanation:
We check if a number can be divided by 2. If there is no remainder, the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.

Flowchart Steps:
Start 
Input number 
Check if number % 2 = 0 
Yes: Output "Even" 
No: Output "Odd" 
End

Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List

Explanation:
We assume the first number is the smallest. Then, we compare it with the other numbers and update it when a smaller number is found.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input list of numbers →
Set smallest = first number →
Loop through the list →
If current number < smallest, update smallest →
End loop →
Output smallest →
End

Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers

Explanation:
We count how many numbers are positive and how many are negative. A positive number is greater than zero, and a negative number is less than zero.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input list of numbers →
Set positive = 0, negative = 0 →
Loop through the list →
If number > 0, increase positive count →
If number < 0, increase negative count →
End loop →
Output positive and negative counts →
End

Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List

Explanation:
We create a new list that contains only unique numbers. We add a number only if it does not already exist in the new list.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input list of numbers →
Create empty unique list →
Loop through the list →
If number is not in unique list, add it →
End loop →
Output unique list →
End

Task 6: Find All Prime Numbers Up to N

Explanation:
A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself. We check every number from 2 up to N and print the prime ones.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input N →
For each number from 2 to N →
Check if number has any divisors →
If prime, output number →
End loop →
End

Task 7: Merge Two Sorted Lists

Explanation:
We combine two sorted lists into one list and then sort the combined list.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input sorted list A and sorted list B →
Merge both lists →
Sort merged list →
Output merged list →
End

Task 8: Find the Second Largest Number

Explanation:
We keep track of the largest and second largest numbers while checking the list.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input list of numbers →
Set largest and second largest →
Loop through the list →
Update largest and second largest when needed →
End loop →
Output second largest →
End

Task 9: Check if a String is a Palindrome

Explanation:
A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. We reverse the string and compare it with the original string.

Flowchart Steps:
Start →
Input string →
Reverse the string →
Compare original and reversed strings →
If equal, output "Palindrome" →
Else, output "Not a Palindrome" →
End

Task 10: Generate Fibonacci Sequence

Explanation:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each next number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

Flowchart Steps:
Start 
Input N 
Set first = 0, second = 1 
Loop to generate next numbers 
Calculate next = first + second 
Output next number 
Update values 
End loop 
End
